This version is a stripped version containing all the matlab scripts that's needed in one single directory. It also comes with a simpler MyLake that only concerns with heat balance and nothing about lake water chemistry. The part about light attenuation however can be improved. 

This version has been tested with Matlab and Octave, but the version for Octave may be important. Always try the newest version. Octave needs optional packages. See other readmes. 

The input files' format has been changed from Excel files to tab delimited. modelinputs_v12_1b.m describes how the input files are read. Arguments for Excel sheets need to be something but it can really be anything (not used).

Some scripts have EOL for DOS and some have Unix format. 

The main function is solvemodel_v12_1b.m (full MyLake) and solvemodel_v12_1k.m (heat balance only Mylake). 

Some experiences shows that all simulation results are virtually the same using Octave and Matlab. Comparison between v12_1b and v12_1k for heat balance also shows that there's little difference between the outputs. v12_1k runs 10 to 40 percent faster than v12_1b.
