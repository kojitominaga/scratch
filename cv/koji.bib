	abstract = {A model network comprising climate models, a hydrological model, a catchment-scale model for phosphorus biogeochemistry, and a lake thermodynamics and plankton dynamics model was used to simulate phosphorus loadings, total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations in Lake Vansjø, Southern Norway. The model network was automatically calibrated against time series of hydrological, chemical and biological observations in the inflowing river and in the lake itself using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm. Climate projections from three global climate models ({GCM}: {HadRM}3, {ECHAM}5r3 and {BCM}) were used. The {GCM} model {HadRM}3 predicted the highest increase in temperature and precipitation and yielded the highest increase in total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations in the lake basin over the scenario period of 2031–2060. Despite the significant impact of climate change on these aspects of water quality, it is minimal when compared to the much larger effect of changes in land-use. The results suggest that implementing realistic abatement measures will remain a viable approach to improving water quality in the context of climate change.},

	abstract = {A large number and wide variety of lake ecosystem models have been   developed and published during the past four decades. We identify two   challenges for making further progress in this field. One such challenge   is to avoid developing more models largely following the concept of   others ('reinventing the wheel'). The other challenge is to avoid   focusing on only one type of model, while ignoring new and diverse   approaches that have become available ('having tunnel vision'). In this   paper, we aim at improving the awareness of existing models and   knowledge of concurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, without   covering all possible model tools and avenues. First, we present a broad   variety of modelling approaches. To illustrate these approaches, we give   brief descriptions of rather arbitrarily selected sets of specific   models. We deal with static models (steady state and regression models),   complex dynamic models ({CAEDYM}, {CE}-{QUAL}-W2, Delft 3D-{ECO}, {LakeMab},   {LakeWeb}, {MyLake}, {PCLake}, {PROTECH}, {SALMO}), structurally dynamic models   and minimal dynamic models. We also discuss a group of approaches that   could all be classified as individual based: super-individual models   (Piscator, Charisma), physiologically structured models,   stage-structured models and traitbased models. We briefly mention   genetic algorithms, neural networks, Kalman filters and fuzzy logic.   Thereafter, we zoom in, as an in-depth example, on the multi-decadal   development and application of the lake ecosystem model {PCLake} and   related models ({PCLake} Metamodel, Lake Shira Model, {IPH}-{TRIM}3D-{PCLake}).   In the discussion, we argue that while the historical development of   each approach and model is understandable given its 'leading principle',   there are many opportunities for combining approaches. We take the point   of view that a single 'right' approach does not exist and should not be   strived for. Instead, multiple modelling approaches, applied   concurrently to a given problem, can help develop an integrative view on   the functioning of lake ecosystems. We end with a set of specific   recommendations that may be of help in the further development of lake   ecosystem models.},

	abstract = {Three process-oriented dynamic acidification models were applied to a long-term monitoring site without calibration to evaluate the influence of model structural differences on simulation. The models were simplified to share as many commonalities as possible so that the main structural differences could be investigated. The models differed in sub-models for cation exchange, organic acids and acid anion speciation. All models were populated with 'equivalent' parameters by systematic input mapping. The influence of input variability was addressed through Monte Carlo parameter sampling. The three models behaved exactly the same for tracers (e. g. sulphate and chloride), indicating successful cross-parameterization of the models. Differences in model structure had an impact on some of the simulated chemical parameters. In particular, models using Gapon cation exchange simulated higher base saturation levels in the long run than their Gaines-Thomas counterparts, but simulated lower base cation concentration and acid neutralizing capacity in soil solution when acid deposition levels were high. Multiple-model evaluation frameworks as presented here allow for greater certainty in model predictions; ultimately, this type of framework should be employed when evaluating the impacts of future climate and environmental changes on soil and surface water hydrogeochemistry.},

The observed crown condition of sugar maple improved significantly over the study period; in contrast, short-term mortality rate did not improve. The risk of sugar maple mortality could be predicted from decline index data for a single year indicating that the risk of tree death increases With higher decline index values (declining crown condition). Moreover, using 2 years of decline index data indicated that the risk of tree death also increased with the length of consecutive time individual trees have higher decline index values.

	title = {Modelling the chemistry of soil and surface water at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, {USA}},
	abstract = {Acid deposition may cause persistent adverse effects in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. The extent of acidification depends on the historical, current and future acid deposition levels as well as the geological sensitivity in the region. Even though acid deposition has decreased in most areas in North America, recovery (biological and chemical) has been limited due to complex biogeochemical processes. 
We employed {MAGIC} (Model of Acidification in Groundwater in Catchments), a dynamic acidification model to a forested sub-catchment at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, {USA}, to predict the changes in soil and stream chemistry in response to proposed emission scenarios (further reductions of 38 \% ({SO}2) and 47 \% ({NOx}) of the 1990 levels by 2020). Model predictions depend strongly on model calibration, and calibration depends on available observational data. Differences between modelled and observed data in general decrease with increasing length of the time series used in calibration. {MAGIC} was calibrated to observed stream chemistry (1971–2004) using {PEST} (Parameter Estimate), which is an objective model-independent calibration technique (weighted, lumped observation-to-model correlation r = 0.97). At this site, stream chemistry has acidified and is slowly recovering, while soil chemistry has shown no improvement. Stream acid neutralising capacity is predicted to rise above zero by 2013; nonetheless, soil base saturation recovery is very slow (less than 10 \%, a 1971 level, in 2100). Our findings suggest that the slow recovery of soil chemistry reflects limited natural recovery process (mineral weathering), rather than unsatisfactory reduction in acid deposition.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, many lakes in temperate regions have experienced increased water temperature and shortened duration of ice cover. These physical changes are in turn deemed to impact lake biota, for example by interfering with food chain dynamics or by dictating species shift. Here we produce a forecast of lake physical response to changing climate by connecting a dynamically downscaled weather scenario for Fennoscandia to a physically-based lake model ({MyLake}). In order to facilitate systematic representation of the lakes in the region, we designed the simulation using 27 generic lake types with varying depth, area and colour levels. Lake responses such as ice duration and water temperature were then simulated both for the control period 1970-2000 and the scenario period 2070-2100. The model predicts striking pan-regional changes over the 100 years: shorter ice duration (-50 days), higher epilimnion water temperature (+1.65 K annual mean), and {\textgreater} 10 \% increase in irradiance reaching the water surface. The magnitude of change varies geographically, with the most vulnerable areas being in southern or more oceanic areas where ice thinning accelerates water heating.},

	abstract = {1) Crown condition of individual hardwood trees (n ≈ 14,000) in south-central Ontario, Canada was used to predict tree mortality. Using 18 years of crown condition monitoring data, we found that trees exhibiting greater crown damage are subject to reduced survivorship in the future. Using a model that predicts survivorship on the basis of two years of crown condition data prior to the beginning of the modelled period, we found that a chronic exposure to greater crown damage, rather than a sudden onset of crown degradation, is related to tree mortality. Survivorship and the extent to which crown condition affects mortality significantly differed among the forest regions in south-central Ontario. These results will be helpful for selective cutting practices in which subset of trees are harvested and thus trees that are likely to die in the next 15 to 25 years need to be identified. The results are also useful for government agencies such as the Ontario Ministry of the Environment that need information that links tree mortality and crown condition.

2) The same crown condition data averaged at the plot level were estimated using vegetation indices calculated from satellite images from Landsat 5 {TM} and Landsat 7 {ETM}. Some vegetation indices successfully estimated crown condition observed through ground surveys with simple linear regression analyses. More investigation is recommended to further confirm which vegetation index can best estimate ground crown condition, by increasing the number of plots and by widening the range of crown condition variable (i.e., including plots experiencing high crown damage).},

	abstract = {Dynamic acidification models are used to predict future change in soil and surface water chemistry under various prescribed deposition scenarios. However, uncertainties in the application of dynamic acidification models, including the choice of the model (structure), input data, and model calibration, will influence prediction.
In this thesis, uncertainties in predictions of four widely used dynamic acidification models ({MAGIC}, {PnET}-{BGC}, {SAFE} and {VSD}) were objectively evaluated using the long-term data record at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest ({HBEF}), New Hampshire, {USA}. The evaluation incorporated input data standardisation, Monte Carlo simulation, systematic calibration, and an ensemble model analysis, to ensure equal treatment of the models.
All models could be calibrated against observed data (stream and soil chemistry), but predictions and calibrated parameter space differed among models, suggesting that a range of equally reliable predictions coexisted. Nonetheless, the overall agreement of prediction patterns illustrated that all models are reliable and robust management tools with respect to acid emission control.
An ensemble of calibrated models predicted that future recovery at {HBEF} will be limited under currently legislated acid emission, but with further reductions in emission, a faster and greater recovery was predicted.},

Through a literature survey, we document the growing   importance of numerical aquatic ecosystem models while also noting the   difficulties, up until now, of the aquatic scientific community to make   significant advances in these models during the past two decades.   Through a common forum for aquatic ecosystem modellers we aim to (i)   advance collaboration within the aquatic ecosystem modelling community,   (ii) enable increased use of models for research, policy and   ecosystem-based management, (iii) facilitate a collective framework   using common (standardised) code to ensure that model development is   incremental, (iv) increase the transparency of model structure,   assumptions and techniques, (v) achieve a greater understanding of   aquatic ecosystem functioning, (vi) increase the reliability of   predictions by aquatic ecosystem models, (vii) stimulate model   inter-comparisons including differing model approaches, and (viii) avoid   're-inventing the wheel', thus accelerating improvements to aquatic   ecosystem models. We intend to achieve this as a community that fosters   interactions amongst ecologists and model developers. Further, we   outline scientific topics recently articulated by the scientific   community, which lend themselves well to being addressed by integrative   modelling approaches and serve to motivate the progress and   implementation of an open source model framework.},
