Summary
I am an environmental scientist with a specialisation in massive
computing, currently working as a researcher at postdoc level after my
PhD completed in 2013.

My application fields to date have been bioinformatics,
climate change, anthropogenic pollution,
biogeochemistry, and freshwater systems. My
interests in computing and numerical methods include machine
  learning, parameter estimation, quantification of
  modelling uncertainty and data visualisation. Highlights
in computing experiences:

  
Simultaneous control of 1000 computing nodes,
3 HPC platforms (Notur/Norstore, Sharcnet, Amazon EC2),
Large data and file management (terabytes), and
Advanced level skills in Unix, Python and
  R.
