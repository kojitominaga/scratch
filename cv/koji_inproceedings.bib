@inproceedings{tominaga_future_2012,
	Abstract = {In recent decades, many lakes in temperate regions have experienced increased water temperature and shortened duration of ice cover. These physical changes are in turn deemed to impact lake biota, for example by interfering with food chain dynamics or by dictating species shift. Here we produce a forecast of lake physical response to changing climate by connecting a dynamically downscaled weather scenario for Fennoscandia to a physically-based lake model ({MyLake}). In order to facilitate systematic representation of the lakes in the region, we designed the simulation using 27 generic lake types with varying depth, area and colour levels. Lake responses such as ice duration and water temperature were then simulated both for the control period 1970-2000 and the scenario period 2070-2100. The model predicts striking pan-regional changes over the 100 years: shorter ice duration (-50 days), higher epilimnion water temperature (+1.65 K annual mean), and {\textgreater} 10 \% increase in irradiance reaching the water surface. The magnitude of change varies geographically, with the most vulnerable areas being in southern or more oceanic areas where ice thinning accelerates water heating.},

@inproceedings{tominaga_modelling_2008,
	Abstract = {Acid deposition may cause persistent adverse effects in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. The extent of acidification depends on the historical, current and future acid deposition levels as well as the geological sensitivity in the region. Even though acid deposition has decreased in most areas in North America, recovery (biological and chemical) has been limited due to complex biogeochemical processes. 
We employed {MAGIC} (Model of Acidification in Groundwater in Catchments), a dynamic acidification model to a forested sub-catchment at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, {USA}, to predict the changes in soil and stream chemistry in response to proposed emission scenarios (further reductions of 38 \% ({SO}2) and 47 \% ({NOx}) of the 1990 levels by 2020). Model predictions depend strongly on model calibration, and calibration depends on available observational data. Differences between modelled and observed data in general decrease with increasing length of the time series used in calibration. {MAGIC} was calibrated to observed stream chemistry (1971--2004) using {PEST} (Parameter Estimate), which is an objective model-independent calibration technique (weighted, lumped observation-to-model correlation r = 0.97). At this site, stream chemistry has acidified and is slowly recovering, while soil chemistry has shown no improvement. Stream acid neutralising capacity is predicted to rise above zero by 2013; nonetheless, soil base saturation recovery is very slow (less than 10 \%, a 1971 level, in 2100). Our findings suggest that the slow recovery of soil chemistry reflects limited natural recovery process (mineral weathering), rather than unsatisfactory reduction in acid deposition.},
