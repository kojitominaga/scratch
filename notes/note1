Thoughts from the meeting 7-8 November 2013

The variables to explain the BV diffusion: 
- oceanity-continentality gradient and/or wind speed, other geopgraphical/climatorological variations
- area (this may be corrected for the wind/fetch (wind direction, topography)
  - possibly consider the depth function (hypsography)
- shading (volley lakes) -- maybe take care of it at the input data level?

Not very sure about the best statistical approach for this -- need to check with Tom

Mainly interested in deeper lakes

Explains the difference between the Minnesota lakes and the Nordic (or Norwegian) lakes
- this should mean that we should do two ways (i) similar statistical methods to the MN folks (ii) the best statistical methods incorporating all variables of our choices

Temperature at depths (if Tom's brother's equipment works) spring to summer --> should be perfect for calibrating the model
